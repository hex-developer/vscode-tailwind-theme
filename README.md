# Tailwind theme
#### A VSCode theme based on the Tailwind CSS website.

Why? Because I like the Tailwind colors.

## Notes:
- Only dark mode is currently supported.
- The current `index.ts` does not match the `theme.json` file. This will be (hopefully) updated in the future.

## Usage:
- Go to https://github.com/hex-developer/vscode-tailwind-theme/releases/latest and download the `.vsix` file
- Press Ctrl-Shift-P (or Cmd-Shift-P) and type `vsix` in the search bar. Choose the first option and select the file you downloaded earlier.
- You will be prompted to change your theme. Select Tailwind Dark. If you aren't prompted, click on `Set Color Theme`.
- Enjoy your new theme!
