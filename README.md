# Tailwind theme
#### A VSCode theme based on the Tailwind CSS website.

Why? Because I like the Tailwind colors.

## Notes:
- Only dark mode is currently supported.
- The current `index.ts` does not match the `theme.json` file. This will be (hopefully) updated in the future.

## Usage:
- Install the extension and you will be prompted to change your theme. Select Tailwind Dark.
